Basic gameplay is functional, but the following items remain outstanding:

- ‚òê Menu Zhuzh
- ‚òê More than 2 basic puzzles
- ‚òê Tutorial
- ‚òê Hints
- ‚òê Sound Effects
- ‚òê Music

## Instructions

Each row and column has the list of contiguous cells to punch in order to form the image, or `0` if no cells in the row or column should be punched. Punch all the correct cells to win!

Controls:
- ‚¨ÖÔ∏è‚û°Ô∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è Navigate cells
- üÖæÔ∏è "Mark" selected cell - Marking does not count toward score; use it to track the game however you like.
- ‚ùé "Punch" selected cell - Punching a cell that aught not to be punched will cost a Gaffe. Lose all your Gaffes, and it's game over!

## Building

A basic Python script called `build` handles the build process. It will require `pillow` version `11.1.0`, per the `requirements.txt`. Running `./build` will process the puzzle image files under `puzzles` into a file that Pico-8 can work with, and will also export a web build of the game. Pass `--clean` to delete the `out` folder, or `--no-export` to skip the web export.
